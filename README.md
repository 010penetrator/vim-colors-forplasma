Vim color scheme
Originally by the31k
Designed to be used in terminal mode only. GUI is not supported.
Terminal must be capable of displaying 256 colors. Ensure your TERM environment variable is set appropriately.
Based on [wombat256](https://github.com/vim-scripts/wombat256.vim) color scheme by [bmdavll](https://github.com/bmdavll).

## perun.vim
Neovim (Vim GUI only) colorscheme based on the default `desert.vim`.
Originally by Aleksandar Radunovic
### Installation
Place `colors/perun.vim` in your `<vim-config-dir>/colors/` directory.
**NOTE:** Ensure that your terminal emulator supports true color. - [More info](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-use-true-color-in-the-terminal)
### Terminal colors
Take a look inside [`terminal`](https://github.com/aradunovic/perun.vim/tree/master/terminal) directory.

### About
A light colour scheme designed with the following goals:
1. usable in high glare conditions
2. look like writing and annotations on paper
3. be simple: no configuration, custom terminal colours, etc.
Should work out of the box for 256 colour terminals and 24bit gui/terminals.
If something doesn't look quite right, please open and issue with a description
of the problem and ideally a screenshot.
Inspired by [papercolor-theme](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme)
by [Nikyle Nguyen](https://github.com/NLKNguyen).
### Configuration
This is a lean mean colorscheme. There is no configuration.
